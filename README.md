# Skittle-Colour-Detection

 In this project, I aimed to detect the different colours/flavours of skittles, and detect how many of each colour are in a pack. I chose to tackle this problem with ai, as i've always thought the flavours of skittles in a pack are sometimes skewed towards favouring certain flavours. 
 This ai can help me detect this, as it can differentiate between the different flavours. As I am in the UK, the 5 different colours/flavours of a standards skittles pack is: Green(Apple), Orange(Orange), Red(Strawberry), Purple(Blackcurrant) and Yellow(Lemon).
